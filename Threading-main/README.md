# Threading

This project is a Python Tkinter application that displays multiple labeled boxes.

Each box contains a numerical value that refreshes at a set interval and flashes a color change to indicate the refresh.

The refresh process is handled using multithreading to ensure smooth updates for each box.

## Features

- **Flashing Colors**: The boxes briefly flash yellow when their values are refreshed, indicating an update.
- **Multithreading**: Each box is updated in its own thread, ensuring asynchronous updates without freezing the UI.
- **Exit Button**: A convenient exit button is provided to stop the application gracefully.
